    "EVERY variable in python has a \"type,\" indicating what sort of thing it _is_ (integer, string, etc). **\"Type\" is effectively synonymous with \"class.\"** To say that \"x is an integer\" is identical to saying that \"x has class integer\" or \"x has type integer.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The class (type) determines:\n",
    "1. What functions you can call on it. E.g. if `x` is a string, you can call `x.upper()` to get an uppercase version of it, but if `x` is an integer, running `x.upper()` will throw an error. \n",
    "2. How operators work on it. `1 + 2` returns `3` but `'1' + '2'` returns `'12'`, because `1` and `2` have class `int` while `'1'` and `'2'` have class `str`.\n",
    "3. How you create one.\n",
    "  * Some classes are defined in the core python language (integers, strings, lists, etc).  These are called _built-in types_, and each has a special syntax for creating it. For example `x = 1` makes x an integer, while `x = '1'` makes it a string, and `x = [1]` makes it a list (with one element, the integer 1).\n",
    "  * For all other types (anything you define yourself, or `import`), you create them by calling the name and passing in any arguments needed to customize it. E.g.:"
