# Teaching
A collection of instructive jupyter notebooks (by me) and links to excellent internet resources (not by me).

### Notes:
* Sometimes someone on the internet has already done a great job on an important topic, so I don't need to make my own.. In those cases, I've made a row to link to their work (and indicated that it's external)
* I have a number of topics that I'm looking for great internet lessons on (see: Coming "soon"). If you know of a good resource for these, let me know via PM!
